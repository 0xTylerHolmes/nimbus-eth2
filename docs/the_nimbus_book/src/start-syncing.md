# Start syncing

To avoid being hit with minor penalties, the beacon node should be [completely synced](./keep-an-eye.md#keep-track-of-your-syncing-progress) before submitting your deposit.

This is particularly important if you are joining a network that's been running for a while.

To start syncing `medalla` , from the `nimbus-eth2` repository, run:

```
make medalla
```

> **Note:** If you planning on [making a deposit](./deposit.md) before the network you'd like to join has launched -- whether mainnet or a testnet -- you can safely skip this step.
